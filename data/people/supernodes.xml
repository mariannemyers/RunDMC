  <h1>SuperNodes</h1>

  <p>As a means to better serve and understand its developer community,
    MarkLogic formed the SuperNodes group in summer 2011.  Members of this
    select group are among the most experienced and knowledgable developers in
    our community.  The purposes of the program are

    <ul>
      <li>To provide a direct connection between MarkLogic and power-users in our community.</li>
      <li>To provide recognition and status to strong, active community members.</li>
    </ul>

    MarkLogic maintains a exclusive mailing list for SuperNode discussions. On
    occasion, MarkLogic shares early preview "NDA-style" information with
    SuperNodes via this list.  Additional, benefits of membership include
    occasional discounts to MarkLogic events.
